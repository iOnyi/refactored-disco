# DeFi Backend System

This project implements a scalable backend system for a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform using NodeJS, TypeScript, and Postgres. It allows for processing real-time transactions, querying blockchain data from Solana, and providing real-time analytics for user activity and transactions.

### **Overview**

The DeFi Backend System provides the foundation for a secure, real-time trading platform. Built using modern backend technologies, it integrates Solana blockchain transactions, manages user data and balances in a Postgres database, and supports real-time analytics for transaction monitoring.

### **Key Features**

- **Solana Blockchain Integration**: Query the Solana blockchain to process transactions and retrieve real-time data.
- **Transaction Processing**: Automatically process transactions initiated by users and ensure they are securely recorded.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Provides real-time analytics for trading activity, including user balances, transaction history, and trade volumes.
- **Database Management**: Efficiently handles high-volume transaction data using Postgres, optimized for speed and reliability.

### **Technologies Used**

- **NodeJS**: Runtime for the server and backend logic.
- **TypeScript**: For strong typing and better maintainability.
- **Postgres**: Relational database for storing transaction data, user information, and analytics.
- **Solana**: Blockchain integration to fetch transaction data and interact with Solana-based DeFi protocols.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Utilizing WebSockets for real-time data push to the frontend.

### **Installation & Setup**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
